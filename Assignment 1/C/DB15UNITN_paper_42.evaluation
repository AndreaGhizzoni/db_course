For each part, the errors are cataloged as Minor[M] or Critical[C].

===== PART A 
> ER
1-M AirplaneType must land on at least one Airport.
    
2-C The relation between Airports and Cities called "provinces" needs to be an
    attribute of Cities (or better named, Location) because in the same 
    province there could be more airports.

3-C The relation between Technician and AirplaneType must be Total 
    Participation because a Tech needs to fix at least one AirplaneType, 
    otherwise is a useless Employee.  

4-C If a company that can build aircraft has no aircraft produced, then that 
    company doesn't produce aircraft. For these reason, company should be an
    attribute of AirplaneType or the relation between Companies and Airplain
    Types needs to be Total Participation.

6-C If the entity LegInstance is weak could not have a primary key, because 
    according to definition of weak entity, his primary key should be the 
    primary key of Legs, AirplaneType and a date.


> SCHEMA
1-M He puts the NOT NULL constraint not in the schema but under it where he
    describe the Foreign key.

2-M In my opinion the entity Pilots and Technicians can be collapsed into 
    Employees with a new attribute "type" that describe if the employer is tech
    or a pilot.

3-C He has write that he can represents the LegInstance into the schema when 
    could just put another entity with primary key taken by Legs Airplane and a
    date.


> SQL 
1-M He use "int" instead of "INTEGER".



===== PART B 
> ER
1-M A Spy can have no Skills, but according to the text is reasonably to think
    that a Spy has at least one skill; so the relation between Spy and 
    Specialization needs to be a Total Participation

2-M Use the Spy name as primary key implies that can not be two spies with the
    same name, that can happened; the solution is to put an id.

3-C There is not the possibilities to create Group of Spies that participate on
    a mission

4-C According by text a Spy has a list of nickname, so the relation between
    Spies and Nicknames needs to be Total Participation

5-C It is not clear that a Spy receives a grade from a completed mission
    ( according by text ) because the attribute Grade is in the relation called
    "Participates", so I assumed that a Spy gets a grade by participate into a 
    mission, completed or not.

6-C The attribute AGLocation in Agencies should be a relation with entity 
    Country, because otherwise there is a redundant data.


> SCHEMA
1-M He puts the NOT NULL constraint not in the schema but under it where he
    describe the Foreign key.


> SQL
1-C In Mission create statement, secondaryObjective is marked as NOT NULL, when
    in Schema is not.

1-M He use "int" instead of "INTEGER".
